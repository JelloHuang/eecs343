1. Several goals, including resource utilization, timeliness and robustness, guide the design of an operating
system. Give an example of two such design goals and explain how they might contradict each other.



2. List three hardware features that enable the implementation of operating system functionality and explain the
significance of each. For instance, a fixed rate clock allows the creation of a variable timer for timesharing.



3. What is the purpose of a system call in an operating system



4. To a programmer, a system call looks like any other call to a library procedure. Is it important that a
programmer know which library procedures result in system calls? Under what circumstances and why?



5. How do user programs and system services interact in a microkernel architecture? What are the advan-
tages/disadvantages of the microkernel approach to system design?



6. From the course webpage download the handout for an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. After
downloading it, follow the directions from the Projects' section. The life directory includes an incomplete
Makefile with a few dfinitions and mostly empty targets. Your task is to complete this Makefile without
changing the rest of the project file names or locations). Please include the body of your new Makefile
with the rest of this assignment.
